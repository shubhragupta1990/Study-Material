Dokcer Container commands
-----------------------------
7 To see the list of running container
 
   docker container ls

8 To see the list of all container(running and stopped)
 
    docker ps -a

9 To find detailed info about a container
  
    docker inspect containername/containerid

10 To stop a container
    
    docker stop containername/containerid

11 To start a container
    
    docker start containername/containerid

12 To restart a container
  
    docker restart containername/containerid
   To restart a container after 20 seconds

13 To initialise a container

Run command options
   -------------------
   -it  Opens an interactive terminal in the container         where we can fire linux commands
   -d   Start the container in detached mode as a         background process(deamon)
   -p   Used for port mapping it it will bind the port of         docker host with the port of the container.Dcoker         host port is called external port,container port is         called internal port
        Eg: -p 8080:80
        here 8080 is external port ie dockerhost port
        80 is internal port ie docker container port
   -P   Will publish the port numbers.ie docker will map         the internal port of the container with an external         port on the docker host and this external port will         be some number greater than 30000
   -v   Used for mounting volumes into the container
   --volumes-from   Used for creating reusable volumes that        can be shared between multiple containers
   --network  Used for associating a container with a        specific network
   --name  Used for assigning a name for a container
   -e Used for passing environment variables to the       containers
   -rm  Used for deleting the container on exit from the         container
   --restart  This will attempt to restart the container if it stops
   -m  used to specifuy an upper liit on the amount of memory that a container can use
   -c  used to specify the percentage of CPU that a container can use





14 To Remove a stopped container
   docker rm containername/containerid

15 To remove a running container forcebly
   docker rm -f containername/containerid

16 To stop all running container
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

17 To remove all stopped containers
    docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

18 To remove all running and stopped containers
   docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

19 To find the logs generated by a container
   docker logs containername/containerid

20 To find the ports used by a container
   docker port containername/containerid

** To execute a command or a a container from outside
   docker exec -it containername/containerid command name
